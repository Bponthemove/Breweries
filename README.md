Simple app to learn various things. I have kept the css and html very simple in order to focus on learning the following:
- Webpack. First time I have installed webpack from scratch, trying to understand the basics.
- Serviceworkers. First pwa I have done, so trying to understand the basics of serviceworkers and caching.
- Jest. First time I have introduced testing. Only done some basic tests. I am trying to implement some more over the coming days. 
API is openbrewerydb which is probably american as it has way more results if you look up breweries in the states than in europe, but that was not the point of this project.
Still needs refactoring and adding more tests.
